1. Get the Android Development Environment
http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html

2. Import BitcoinMiner

3. Only important files are:
  - (implementation) BitcoinMiner\app\src\main\java\com\example\bitcoinminer\MainActivity.java
  - (layout) BitcoinMiner\app\src\main\res\layout\activity_main.xml
  - (manifest) BitcoinMiner\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml

4. To add images
  - BitcoinMiner\app\src\main\res\ (any drawable folder, the only difference is size)
  
5. I just got this basically set up so that it works and so that you can see how the code works.
  Feel free to edit the layout (its meh right now) and finish the implementation counter logic stuff.  It's late, I'm tired.
  Ofc, adding the actual bitcoin mining part would also be good.
